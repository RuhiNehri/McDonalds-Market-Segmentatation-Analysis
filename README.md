# McDonalds-Market-Segmentatation-Analysis

The purpose of this case study is to offer an illustration of market segmentation
analysis using a different empirical data set.

For this case study, imagine that you are McDonald’s, and you would want
to know if consumer segments exist that have a distinctly different image of
McDonald’s.

Understanding such systematic differences of brand perceptions by
market segments informs which market segments to focus on, and what messages to
communicate to them.

The focus will be  on market segments with a positive perception, and strengthen the positive perception. Or the focus can be 
a market segment that currently perceives McDonald’s in a negative way. In this case, the key drivers of the negative perception 
is to be understood, and modify them.
